*Build great websites with content from anywhere.*

## The entire Internet is your database

JSON is today’s de facto lingua franca for content on the web. It’s lightweight, flexible, and instantly familiar to anyone who has written JavaScript before. [Thousands of services](http://www.storyteller.io) already provide their data with APIs that speak JSON, making it quicker than ever to access content.

Solidus provides a straightforward workflow to:

 - Fetch JSON from APIs (or simple static files)
 - Build pages that transform JSON data into amazing content
 - Bootstrap a Grunt.js assets workflow (Sass and more!)
 - Deploy your website and easily scale it
